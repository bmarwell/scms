#Core Concepts in Apache Shiro

This part of the documentation covers Shiro's core architectural concepts.

First we'll present Shiro's architecture and a summary of each core concept.  Then we'll cover the most important concept in Shiro - the `Subject`, a security-specific 'view' of a <em>single</em> application user.  Next we'll discuss the <tt>SecurityManager</tt>, an application singleton that manages all Subjects for the application, and as well as the SecurityManager's supporting components that do most of Shiro's heavy lifting. Then onto Realms, the security-specific DAOs, Shiro communicates with and then Permissions, the building block of any security policy.
