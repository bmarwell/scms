= SCMS

SCMS (Simple Content Management System) is very simple file-based CMS - no database required! +
SCMS exists to support static websites or dynamic sites that achieve their dynamic nature through JavaScript.

SCMS is extraordinarily simple: given a source directory tree of Markdown and html content files, it applies one
or more page templates to the content, resulting in a new 1-to-1 directory tree with fully rendered
HTML files. It is expected that you will manage your content (markdown files, images, etc) using a version control
system like Git or Subversion.

When it comes time to preview your changes as complete HTML or publish your site to web servers, you run a simple SCMS
command line script to render your web site. You can take the resulting directory tree and either commit it to version \
control or just push it directly to your web servers. Super easy.

Resulting output is fully customizable via http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html[Velocity templates]

== Quickstart

=== Prerequisites

SCMS is a Java-based command line program. You do *not* need to know anything about Java and the generated
site does not require Java. Java is _only_ needed to execute the scms command line script.

Check to see if you have Java installed by running the following command at a terminal prompt:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -version
----

and you should see something like this:

----
java version "1.8.0_92"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_92-b14)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.92-b14, mixed mode)
----

If you don't see something similar, http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp[install Java] first and ensure the `java`
command is in your `$PATH`. Ok, moving onâ€¦

=== Download SCMS

You may http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/leshazlewood/scms/scms/0.3.0/scms-0.3.0.zip[download the latest stable SCMS version] from Maven Central.

=== Install SCMS

Unzip the SCMS distribution .zip file (e.g. scms-0.3.0.zip). Add the resulting `scms-0.3.0/bin` directory
to your `PATH` environment variable. For example, on Unix, Linux and Mac OS X*:

[source,bash]
----
unzip scms-0.3.0.zip
export PATH=scms-0.3.0/bin:$PATH
----

It is recommended that you set this in `~/.bash_profile` so you don't have to do this manually every time you open
a new terminal prompt.

*Windows users can set their PATH via http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm[these instructions]

=== Run SCMS

Once you add the SCMS `bin` directory to your path, you can run it by
simply typing `scms` on the command line:

----
$ scms
----

The above command will show a help menu with further usage instructions.

=== Directory Structure

Create a quick directory structure like the following on your file system. This will be our quick starter project:

----
mysite/
    templates/
----

The `mysite` directory is the root of our quick website project. The `templates` directory is a sub directory.

=== Configuration

Create a `.scms.groovy` file in the root directory of your static website project with the following contents to get started:

[source,groovy]
----
scms {

    excludes = ['templates/**']

    patterns {
        '**/*.md' {
            template = 'templates/default.vtl'
        }
    }
}
----

Here's what the contents mean:

* The `scms` block is the top-level 'wrapper' containing all relevant SCMS configuration.
* The `excludes` property is a comma-delimited list of http://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns[Ant-style pattern] strings. Any
 file discovered matching one of these patterns will *not* be copied by SCMS to the output directory.
 The above example shows what most people want: to exclude any rendering templates.
* The `patterns` block contains one or more Ant-style patterns, each with their own config block to be applied when
 SCMS encounters a file matching that pattern.

The above `**/*.md` Ant-style pattern example in the `patterns` block ensures that, whenever a Markdown file is
encountered in the `mysite` directory or any of its children directories, SCMS will:

. Read the Markdown file's contents
. Convert those contents from Markdown to HTML
. Merge the resulting HTML with the `templates/default.vtl` http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html[Velocity] template.
 We'll cover templates in just a second.

Now our project structure looks like this:

----
mysite/
    templates/
    .scms.groovy
----

=== HTML Template

Create a `default.vtl` template file in the `templates` subdirectory with the following contents:

[source,html]
----
<html>
<body>

$content

</body>
</html>
----

This is a http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html[Velocity] template file (the `.vtl` extension
indicates a Velocity Template Language file). When SCMS runs, any encountered Markdown file will be
rendered to HTML and then that rendered HTML will replace the `$content` placeholder.

Now our project structure looks like this:

----
mysite/
    templates/
        default.vtl
    .scms.groovy
----

=== Our First Content File

Create an `index.md` Markdown file at the root of your sample project with the following contents:

----
# Hello World

This is my first SCMS-rendered site!
----

Now our project structure looks like this:

----
mysite/
    templates/
        default.vtl
    .scms.groovy
    index.md
----

=== Render your site

Now that we have our config, an HTML template and an initial bit of Markdown content, we can render our site. Enter the
project root directory:

----
$ cd mysite
----

Now render your site. We'll specify `output` as our destination directory, relative to the project root. SCMS
will render all output to the `output` directory. You can specify a different directory if you want the output to be
somewhere else. Run this:

----
$ scms output
----

After you've run this command, you'll see the following directory structure:

----
mysite/
    output/
        index.html
    templates/
        default.vtl
    .scms.groovy
    index.md
----

See the new `output` directory with the `index.html` file? Open it up and this is what you'll see:

[source,bash]
----
<html>
<body>

<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>This is my first SCMS-rendered site!</p>

</body>
</html>
----

See how the `index.md` file was converted to the `&lt;h1&gt;` and `&lt;p&gt;` content? And then see how the
`$content` placeholder in `default.vtl` was replaced with the converted HTML?

This is what SCMS does - sweet and simple.

=== How does this work?

Now that you've gotten your feet wet, here's what is going on:

SCMS will produce a 1:1 recursive copy of the site in your source directory (the `mysite` directory above) to your
specified destination directory (the `output` directory above). But during that process, it will render all Markdown
files as HTML files using the specified Velocity template(s) in `.scms.groovy`.

As you can infer from `.scms.groovy`, you can have multiple templates: for any file matching a particular pattern,
you can apply a specific template for that pattern. Patterns are matched based on a 'first match wins' policy, so more
specific patterns must be defined before more general patterns. If a file in the source directory tree does not
match a pattern in `.scms.groovy`, it is simply copied to the destination directory unchanged. Any file that you
don't want copied to the destination directory should have a path that matches one of the String patterns in the
`excludes` array.

All that is left now is to learn a little bit of the http://velocity.apache.org/engine/devel/user-guide.html#Velocity_Template_Language_VTL:_An_Introduction[Velocity Template Language]
so you can write as many `.vtl` Velocity templates as you want to customize the rendered output (look and feel) of your
site.

== Build Instructions

This section is only necessary if you want to build SCMS yourself instead of downloading it directly.

SCMS requires http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java 1.8] and http://maven.apache.org/[Maven 3] to build:

----
$ mvn install
----

This will create the SCMS distribution .zip file in the `dist/target` directory. You can unzip the zip file and run
the `bin/scms` script as explained at the top of this document.
